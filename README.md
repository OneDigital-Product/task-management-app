# Task Management Training App

A hands-on training application designed to help Excel power users transition to web development using Next.js, React, and GitHub.

## Training Roadmap Goals

### 3-Hour Workshop Objectives

#### Hour 1: Foundations
- **Translate Excel concepts to web development** - Understand how spreadsheets relate to frontend/backend/database
- **Master GitHub collaboration** - Learn branching, commits, and pull requests to solve the "Final_v2_REAL_FINAL.xlsx" problem
- **Understand CRUD operations** - Connect Excel row operations (add/view/edit/delete) to web development patterns

#### Hour 2: Hands-On Development  
- **Build a functional task tracker** - Create a complete web app with priority color coding (like Excel conditional formatting)
- **Practice GitHub workflow** - Create branches, make commits, and submit pull requests
- **Add smart features** - Implement due dates, filtering, and sorting (mimicking Excel's AutoFilter and date formatting)

#### Hour 3: Advanced Features & Data Visualization
- **Create analytics dashboards** - Build charts and statistics (like Excel pivot charts)
- **Master the development cycle** - From feature planning to code review and merge
- **Gain confidence for independent work** - Use AI tools effectively and understand best practices

### Success Metrics
By completing this training, participants will:
- ✅ Understand how web apps relate to Excel workflows
- ✅ Create and merge GitHub branches independently
- ✅ Use AI to generate code for new features
- ✅ Understand basic CRUD operations
- ✅ Collaborate on code using pull requests
- ✅ Feel confident to start their first web project

### Progressive Learning Path
After the workshop, continue with take-home exercises:
- **Beginners**: Search & Export, Tags & Categories, Comments
- **Intermediate**: Task Assignment, Bulk Operations, Templates
- **Advanced**: Keyboard Shortcuts, Recurring Tasks, Custom Features

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
